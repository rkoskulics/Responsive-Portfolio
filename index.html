			<p>
			I've been working in technology for more than 15 years now.  While most of my work has been in support, I've recently begun branching out into full-stack development.  Check out some of my projects here.<br>I'm an avid hiker and camper, and a mediocre amateur photographer, mostly of my three cats.  I've lived in New Jersey for the last 12 years or so with my wife, Nicole.  When we're not at home doing meal prep we're watching strange movies and weird TV.  It's my dream to be a software engineer for Apple Inc.
